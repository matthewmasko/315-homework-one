        So, how does a classical pianist, turned pastor/theologian, turned web
        developer decide to open a weather and storm chasing business? Well, the
        secret is that I have always been fascinated by the weather, and my
        initial plan was to attend school to study meteorology. Yet, you know
        how life turns out!
